    "details": "Distinctive beings with translucent skin, large almond-shaped eyes, and small stature. Their primary teaching emphasizes personal authenticity: 'PURSUE YOUR PASSION, follow your own way, do your own thing.' Historical contact began in 1947-1948 when they warned the U.S. Government against forming treaties with the Greys, predicting disaster. After their peaceful approach was rejected by the military, they established a treaty with the Hopi Indians in Northern Mexico and Arizona, where they became known as Star Warriors. Due to Grey surveillance, they were forced into hiding with some Hopi Elders. Their story connects to the Hopi legend of two races: the children of the feather (sky beings) and children of the reptile (underground beings). This information comes from Robert Morningsky, a Hopi/Apache dancer, and is documented in sources including 'Star Warriors' and 'American Indian Magic' by Brad Steiger."

Additional variants include reptilian types with claws and praying mantis-like features, plus reported human-grey hybrids. Their activities primarily involve human abduction and experimentation. Various perspectives exist: Scientific views focus on their unknown motives and agendas; New Age interpretations often cast them as negative entities; Conspiracy theories suggest government treaties exchanging human subjects for technology. Main sources include works by David M. Jacobs ('Secret Life'), Whitley Strieber ('Communion'), and Budd Hopkins ('Missing Time', 'Intruders')."

Their mission includes helping Earth transition from the third to fourth dimension and preventing potential future tyranny. They work as ambassadors to assist in human awakening and empowerment. Notable contact cases include Billie Meier's 130+ encounters (1976-1982) with a Pleiadian named Samjese, documented in multiple volumes of 'UFO Contact from the Pleiades' and 'Message From the Pleiades'. Their teachings are also channeled through Barbara Marciniak in 'Bringers of the Dawn'. The Pleiadians later expanded to include other ET races, becoming the Pleiadians Plus. They primarily communicate through channeling, stating it's safer and less conspicuous than physical appearance."

Their claimed connection to Venus has been questioned by scientists due to Venus's inhospitable environment."
