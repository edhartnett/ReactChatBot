      "question": "What is a UFO?",
      "answer": "A UFO is an Unidentified Flying Object. It is 'Something seen in the sky (or on the land, or expceptionally in the water, but thought capable of flight) which the witness could not identify and thought sufficently strange to report to either an offical or unoffical investigating body'. A UFO is the stimulus for a UFO report made by a UFO witness. UFO researchers (often called UFOlogists) study UFO reports and witnesses. UFO researchers cannot directly study UFOs. There are some reports in the literature of different governments recovering craft thought to cause UFO reports, but most of these reports are speculative. The study of UFO reports is referred to as UFOlogy. This implies a scientific basis to the study, when in practice very little scientific research is carried out. After careful investigation about 90% of all UFO reports can be reasonably explained as either natural phenomena or misidentification of normal manmade devices. Sometimes the term IFO is used for these Identified Flying Objects. Those cases which are identified as natural phenomena are often rare or short lived and are worthy of study in their own right. In the early days of investigation used interchangably with the term 'Flying Saucer'. More recently the term Flying Saucer has fallen into disuse, although some researchers use it as a term to specifically refer to an extraterrestrial spacecraft."

      "question": "What is an alien?",
      "answer": "According to my dictionary: ALIEN - belonging to another : a foreign-born resident of a country in which he is not naturalized. Therefore the term alien means, more or less, somebody or something that is in the wrong place. It should be noted that whilst extraterrestrial beings might be a sub-group of aliens, not all aliens are (necessarily) extra-terrestrial. Some people use the term 'space aliens' to refer explicitly to extraterrestrial beings."

      "question": "What are the classifications of UFO reports?",
      "answer": "The main classification of UFO reports is based upon one used by Dr J. Allen Hynek in his book 'The UFO Experience' (Aberlard-Schuman 1972). Classifications include:\n\nNL (nocturnal light): A simple visual sighting of an unidentified flying light seen at night. This group contains 35 to 40 percent of all UFO reports.\n\nND (nocturnal disc): A simple visual sighting of an unidentified flying extended or structured light source seen at night. (This is an extension to Hynek's system).\n\nDD (daylight disc): A simple visual sighting of a UFO with distinct shape seen during the day.\n\nRadar Cases: UFOs detected by radar alone. In more recent years fewer cases involving radar have hit the press. This could be because of a number of factors, for example the government is better at suppressing these reports, or there has been a change in the nature of the phenomenon which makes it less detectable or that many of the early reports were the result of spurious events and false positives which are handled better by more modern equipment.\n\nRadar Visual Cases: UFOs observed visually whilst being simultaneously on radar. From Hynek's study these make up 1 to 2% of reports.\n\nClose Encounters of the first kind (CE1): An observation of a UFO within 150 yards.\n\nClose Encounters of the second kind (CE2): A UFO which leaves physical evidence. Example: A burn where the UFO appeared to touch the ground or the finding of material of unknown makeup.\n\nClose Encounters of the third kind (CE3): A visual sighting of an occupant or entity associated with a UFO. An analysis by Hynek of 650 reports found only 1% to be CE3. These entities are sometimes called UFOnauts. Entities have been described as sampling soil, rocks and plants or might communicate with the witness. These witnesses are sometimes referred to as contactees.\n\nClose Encounters of the fourth kind (CE4): An abduction of an individual by an alien being or race. The most famous being the abduction of Betty and Barney Hill in September 1961. Although abductions have received much publicity, they constitute only a small proportion of all UFO reports.\n\nClose Encounters of the fifth kind (CE5): Direct contact or communication with alien beings. For example: Billie Meier with the Pleiadians, U.S.Govt. with the Greys, or channeling.\n\nNote: After careful investigation, over 90% of UFO reports can be reasonably explained as manmade or natural phenomena. As Charles H. Gibbs-Smith noted, 'the strangeness of a case increases in proportion to the distance, in either time or geographical distance, between the investigator and the location of the report.'"

      "question": "When did UFO sightings start?",
      "answer": "The modern era of UFO reports began with Kenneth Arnold, a Boise, Idaho businessman, who reported seeing nine strange objects flying in formation near Mount Rainier, Washington State on June 24, 1947.\n\nHowever, there were significant earlier reports:\n\n1. World War II Era: Pilots on both sides reported strange lights following their aircraft, which each side initially thought were secret weapons of their opponents. These became known as 'Foo Fighters'.\n\n2. Historical Cases: Even earlier cases exist but are considered more suspect. For example, in 810 AD, Emperor Charlemagne was reportedly thrown from his horse when it was startled by a silver ball that flew down from the sky.\n\nSince Arnold's sighting, UFO reports have become more systematic and better documented, leading to various classification systems and research organizations dedicated to studying these phenomena."

      "question": "What is the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI)?",
      "answer": "For many years there have been small unco-ordinated projects to search for evidence to extraterrestrial life. These have been mainly by looking for unexpected radio transmissions using radio-telescopes. Over the past couple of years NASA has funded a co-ordinated effort to scan the whole sky over a wide range of frequencies. The SETI project was cut from the 1994 NASA budget, however donations have been obtained from a number of individuals which will allow it to continue as a private project but at a lower level of activity."

      "question": "What do we really know about life elsewhere in the universe?",
      "answer": "There has been much speculation about life elsewhere in the universe. Unless UFO contactee and abductee reports are evidence of visitation by beings from elsewhere in the universe, there is very little evidence. Much of the speculation centres around something called the Drake Equation. This attempts to estimate the number of civilisations in the universe by using a number of inprecise variables. The only planet where we have firm evidence of there being civilisation is a place called Earth. Evidence of planets around other star systems has relied upon complex calculations based upon minute variations in the star's 'wobble' about its axis. Recent improvements in imaging systems have improved the reliability of these observations. It is likely that the smallest extra-solar planets detected are two to three times the mass of Jupiter. There is no detailed information on the structure or conditions on these planets. It is not known if any of these planets could support life. Many of the molecules believed to be essential to the formation of life have been detected in interstellar space. Amino acids have been found in some meteorites. These tend to be equal mixes of left and right handed forms, which is more likely to be the result of a chemical rather than a biological process."

      "question": "What are the Marfa Lights?",
      "answer": "The Marfa Lights are mysterious balls of light that appear, change different colors, and dance around in the air. They were named after the town where they frequently appear - Marfa, Texas - though similar phenomena have been reported in other areas. Various theories attempt to explain these lights, including:\n\n1. Ball lightning\n2. Car headlights\n3. Alien spacecraft\n\nA notable sighting was documented on September 1, 1992, in Marfa, Texas. Dennis Stacy, editor of the MUFON Journal, has written a detailed booklet about the Marfa Lights, discussing many cases and theories. For more information about specific cases and theories, interested parties can contact the author or MUFON directly."

      "answer": "Men In Black are individuals who wear black suits and drive and fly around in unmarked black cars and helicopters. They allegedly threaten people who have claimed to see UFOs into not talking about what they witnessed.\n\nThe very first occurrence of MIB was traced to Albert K. Bender, who was the editor of a flying saucer publication called the 'Space Review'. In the October 1953 issue, he placed an announcement stating that he had come across information that would solve the flying saucer mystery but could not print it because they were ordered not to. The announcement warned others in saucer work to be 'very cautious' before they stopped their publications. Later in an interview, Bender stated that 'three men wearing dark suits' had ordered him to stop publishing flying saucer material, and that he had complied with the order because he had been 'scared to death' of them. He later published a book called 'Flying Saucers and the Three Men in Black'."

      "question": "What is the Tectonic Strain Theory (TST)?",
      "answer": "The Tectonic Strain Theory proposes that electromagnetic effects from seismic activity can affect the human brain and/or physical environment, causing people to think they are witnessing anomalous events. According to this theory, all Forteana including UFOs, ghosts, ESP, sasquatch, and religious fervor can be explained as being caused by seismic activity generating electromagnetic radiation.\n\nThe theory suggests two main mechanisms:\n1. The electromagnetic radiation affects the human brain, causing people to think they are witnesses to an anomalous event\n2. The electromagnetic radiation can luminesce so that it appears as a UFO\n\nThe chief proponent of this theory is Michael Persinger. A variant called the 'Earth Lights' hypothesis was developed by Paul Devereux."

According to Dr. J. Allen Hynek's research, these encounters are relatively rare, comprising only about 1% of documented UFO cases.\n\nUFOnauts have been reported engaging in various activities:\n1. Collecting samples of soil, rocks, and plants\n2. Communicating with witnesses (sometimes telepathically)\n3. Inviting witnesses aboard their craft\n4. Conducting medical examinations (in CE4 abduction cases)\n\nWhile some UFOnaut encounters involve hostile or frightening experiences (particularly in abduction cases), others describe peaceful or educational interactions.

First reported by George Adamski in the early 1950s.\n\nBlues (Star Warriors): Beings with translucent skin, large almond-shaped eyes, and small stature. According to Hopi/Apache sources, they contacted the U.S. government in 1947-1948, warning against dealing with the Greys. Some reportedly made treaties with Hopi Indians.\n\nAryans (Blondes): Blond Nordic Humanoids who allegedly work with the Greys. Said to have shifting loyalties between the Reptoids and the Confederations of Humans.\n\nConfederation of Humans: An organization of alien groups including Vega, Arcturus, Sirius, and Pleiades, reportedly helping and protecting humanity.\n\nNote: Much of this information is considered highly speculative by the scientific community."
